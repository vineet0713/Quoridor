Quoridor is played on a game board of 81 square spaces (9x9).
The objective is to be the first player to move their pawn to any space on the opposite side of the gameboard.
On a turn, a player may either move their pawn (up, down, left, right), or place a wall.
Walls block the path of all pawns. Once placed, walls cannot be moved or removed.
Walls can be placed directly adjacent to two spaces.
However, a wall may not be placed to cut off the only remaining path of a pawn and completely encapsulate it.

After this project, I’ve learned numerous concepts about Java GUI programming, and the software development process.
I learned how to create class diagrams and follow deadlines.
I have gained a lot of skills in using the javax.swing toolkit, in addition to the javax.awt toolkit and javax.io toolkit.
I have also learned how to do simple animation with a Java Timer, as shown on the StartMenu JPanel.

Most importantly, I’ve learned to “think outside the box” and create my own solutions to problems,
like when I developed my data structure to store the wall placements.
