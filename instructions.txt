Quoridor is played on a game board of 81 square spaces (9x9). The objective is to be the first player to move their pawn to any space on the opposite side of the gameboard.

On a turn, a player may either move their pawn (up, down, left, right), or place a wall. Walls block the path of all pawns. Once placed, walls cannot be moved or removed.

Walls can be placed directly adjacent to two spaces. However, a wall may not be placed to cut off the only remaining path of a pawn and completely encapsulate it.
